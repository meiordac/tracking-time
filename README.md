# Introduction
I had a problem of reporting how I am spending my time during the day. I looked at many of the free time tracking programs out there and they didn't really fit my personal needs. I wrote this web ASP.NET Web Application using the last version of the .NET Framework (4.6.2) and the last Nugets. 

# Time Tracking
Keep track of your time with accuracy. You can track your time on your phone, tablet or desktop as it is a web app.

# Customers
Allow your customers to login and analyze time spent on their projects and view reports. There will be different roles.

# Users
Users will adapt quickly to this easy to use web application. You can assign different roles to different users and pick team managers.

# Reports
Analyze reports in real-time. You can export data as a .csv file.
